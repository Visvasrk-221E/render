# SCENE 4: Community Recognition (Day 59)

    'day': 59,
    'date': '2030-03-15',
    'title': 'SCENE 4: THE AWAKENING',
    'location': 'CDC Emergency Operations Center, Atlanta',
    'narrative': '''
Dr. Amanda Foster, CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, stares at the cluster analysis on her screen at 
04:30 AM. Seventeen cases of "viral encephalitis" with identical symptoms across four cities. No animal bite 
history. All victims showing extreme aggression, hydrophobia, and 100% fatality rate.

The breakthrough comes when lab technician James Park sequences viral RNA from victim tissue samples. 
The genome shows 97% similarity to rabies virus, but with engineered modifications to the glycoprotein 
gene - exactly the research warned about in classified biodefense briefings.

At 08:00 AM, Foster briefs CDC Director Martinez via secure video link. The words hang heavy in the sterile air: 
"We have a bioengineered pathogen capable of human-to-human transmission. Current case count: 47 confirmed, 
123 suspected. Estimated R₀: 3.2. Case fatality rate: 98%."

By 12:00, President Harris receives classified briefing in the White House Situation Room. Defense Secretary 
Williams presents satellite intelligence suggesting similar outbreaks emerging in Shanghai, London, and São Paulo. 
The awful realization dawns: this is not a natural emergence. Someone weaponized rabies.

At 16:30, the first inter-agency task force meeting convenes. Representatives from CDC, NIH, DoD, DHS, and 
CIA fill the secure conference room. The questions are stark:
- How many nations have bioweapons programs capable of this?
- Is this an attack or accident?
- Do we have 60 days before global catastrophe?

# SCENE 5: National Emergency Declaration (Day 137)

    'day': 137,
    'date': '2030-06-01',
    'title': 'SCENE 5: THE DECLARATION',
    'location': 'White House Oval Office, Washington D.C.',
    'narrative': '''
President Harris addresses the nation at 20:00 EST, flanked by the Secretaries of Defense, Health, 
and Homeland Security. Her face is gaunt; she hasn't slept more than 3 hours per night in two weeks.

"My fellow Americans, I speak to you tonight during our nation's darkest hour since World War II. 
We face an engineered biological weapon that has claimed 19,648 lives and infected hundreds of thousands 
across seventeen states."

The camera shows empty streets behind her - major cities under martial law enforcement of quarantine 
orders. National Guard checkpoints control interstate travel. Supply chains have collapsed in affected 
regions as truckers refuse to enter "death zones."

Harris continues: "Effective immediately, I am implementing the National Emergency Response Framework. 
Military units will enforce quarantine zones. Citizens are forbidden from leaving designated safe areas. 
Anyone showing symptoms must report immediately to containment facilities."

The economic impact is catastrophic:
- Stock markets lost 47% of value in two weeks
- Unemployment rises to 23% as 43 million jobs disappear  
- Food distribution breaks down in quarantine zones
- Fuel rationing implemented nationwide
- Hospital systems overwhelmed: 340% over capacity

Regional breakdowns emerge:
- Texas Governor declares state independence from federal quarantine
- California implements shoot-to-kill orders for quarantine violators  
- Florida beaches become refugee camps for 2.3 million evacuees
- New York City reports 80% population exodus

# SCENE 6: International Crisis Peak (Day 229)
extended_scenes.append({
    'day': 229,
    'date': '2030-09-01',
    'title': 'SCENE 6: THE BLAME GAME',
    'location': 'UN Security Council, New York',
    'narrative': '''
The chamber is half-empty - delegates from twelve nations participate via video link, unwilling to risk 
travel to New York. Secretary of State Chen's voice echoes through the cavernous hall as she presents 
satellite intelligence to the Security Council.

"These images, taken three days ago, show Russian mobile biological laboratories operating 47 kilometers 
from the Kazakhstan border. Identical facilities appear near former Soviet bioweapons sites in Uzbekistan 
and Georgia."

Russian Ambassador Petrov responds with fury: "The United States spreads lies to cover their own biological 
warfare crimes! We have evidence of American laboratories in Ukraine developing ethnic-specific pathogens!"

Chinese representative Dr. Liu interjects via video: "Both superpowers engage in dangerous research while 
innocent populations suffer. China proposes immediate cessation of all gain-of-function research globally."

The truth is irrelevant now. Trust has collapsed:

ACCUSATION MATRIX:
- USA accuses Russia of bioweapons treaty violations
- Russia blames USA for "laboratory accident" cover-up
- China suggests USA-Russia collaboration gone wrong
- India accuses China of withholding early outbreak data
- Brazil demands reparations from "all developed nations"
- EU calls for international bioweapons monitoring

Military tensions escalate dramatically:
- US deploys 6th Fleet to Black Sea
- Russia moves tactical nuclear weapons to Kaliningrad
- China increases patrols in South China Sea
- NATO activates Article 4 consultations
- India and Pakistan exchange border fire over quarantine violations

The outbreak itself becomes secondary to geopolitical maneuvering. Meanwhile, Rabrid-X133 continues 
spreading in regions too politically unstable for effective containment.
