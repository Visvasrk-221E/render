Dr. Amanda Foster, CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, stares at the cluster analysis. 
Seventeen cases of "viral encephalitis" with identical symptoms across four cities. No animal bite history.

The breakthrough: lab technician sequences viral RNA showing 97% similarity to rabies but with 
engineered glycoprotein modifications. At 08:00 AM, Foster briefs CDC Director Martinez: 
"We have a bioengineered pathogen. Current case count: 47 confirmed, 123 suspected. R₀: 3.2. CFR: 98%."

President Harris receives classified briefing. Intelligence suggests similar outbreaks in Shanghai, 
London, São Paulo. Awful realization: this is weaponized rabies.

First inter-agency meeting: CDC, NIH, DoD, DHS, CIA. Critical questions:
- How many nations capable of this engineering?
- Attack or accident?
- Do we have 60 days before global catastrophe?

President Harris addresses the nation at 20:00 EST. Her face gaunt from two weeks of 3-hour sleep cycles.

"My fellow Americans, we face an engineered biological weapon that has claimed 19,648 lives 
across seventeen states. Effective immediately, military units will enforce quarantine zones."

Empty streets behind her show martial law reality. Economic catastrophe unfolds:
- Stock markets: 47% value loss
- Unemployment: 23% (43 million jobs lost)
- Food distribution collapsed in quarantine zones
- Hospital systems: 340% over capacity

Regional breakdown:
- Texas declares independence from federal quarantine
- California: shoot-to-kill orders for violators
- Florida beaches: refugee camps for 2.3 million
- NYC: 80% population exodus

Half-empty UN chamber. Secretary Chen presents satellite intelligence of Russian mobile bio-labs 
near Kazakhstan. Ambassador Petrov accuses USA of bioweapons development. Chinese Dr. Liu calls 
for global gain-of-function research ban.

Trust has collapsed:
- USA accuses Russia of treaty violations
- Russia blames USA laboratory accident
- China suggests USA-Russia collaboration gone wrong
- Military tensions escalate: US 6th Fleet to Black Sea, Russian tactical nukes to Kaliningrad

The outbreak becomes secondary to geopolitical maneuvering while Rabrid-X133 spreads in 
politically unstable regions unable to contain it.

    'narrative': '''
Dr. Michael Park injects the 847th test dose into a rhesus macaque at 14:30. For 18 months, 
every vaccine candidate failed against Rabrid-X133's engineered glycoprotein. But RX-VAC-7 
shows promise: 73% protection in primate trials.

The breakthrough came from reverse-engineering captured viral samples and Chinese intelligence data 
"borrowed" through cyber operations. The vaccine targets three viral proteins simultaneously, 
preventing immune evasion.

But global production capacity is devastated:
- 67% of pharmaceutical facilities in affected regions destroyed
- Key ingredient sources controlled by hostile nations
- Distribution networks collapsed
- Trust in government vaccination programs at historic lows

President Martinez (Harris died of stress-related cardiac arrest in November 2030) addresses 
the nation from an undisclosed location. The vaccine exists, but producing 330 million doses 
will take 14 months. Priority lists cause civil unrest: military first, then healthcare workers, 
then essential services.

Riots break out in 23 cities when vaccine allocation plans leak. The question haunts every 
American: will you be in the first 100 million, or will you wait and risk infection?
